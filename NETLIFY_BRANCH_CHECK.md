# Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting

It appears that the changes pushed to GitHub are not being automatically deployed to Netlify. Here are some potential reasons and fixes:

## Branch Mismatch

I noticed that your GitHub repository has both `main` and `master` branches, but we've been pushing to `master`. Netlify might be configured to deploy from `main` instead.

### How to Check:

1. Go to your Netlify site: https://app.netlify.com/projects/resonant-salamander-261e98/overview
2. Click on "Site settings" in the top navigation
3. Go to the "Build & deploy" section from the left sidebar
4. Look for "Deploy contexts" and "Branch deploys"
5. Check which branch is set for production deploys (it should be `master`)

### How to Fix:

If Netlify is configured to deploy from `main`:

1. Either change the Netlify settings to deploy from `master` instead
2. Or push our changes to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b main
   git push -f origin main
   ```

## Cache Issues

Netlify might be using a cached version of your site.

### How to Fix:

1. Go to your Netlify site: https://app.netlify.com/projects/resonant-salamander-261e98/overview
2. Click on the "Deploys" tab
3. Find the "Trigger deploy" dropdown
4. Select "Clear cache and deploy site"

## Manual Deployment

If all else fails, you can manually deploy using the `manual-deploy.zip` file:

1. Go to your Netlify site: https://app.netlify.com/projects/resonant-salamander-261e98/overview
2. Click on the "Deploys" tab
3. Find the "Deploy manually" section
4. Upload the `manual-deploy.zip` file we generated

## Netlify Connection Status

Check if Netlify's GitHub integration is working properly:

1. Go to your Netlify site: https://app.netlify.com/projects/resonant-salamander-261e98/overview
2. Click on "Site settings" in the top navigation
3. Go to "Build & deploy" > "Continuous Deployment"
4. Check if the GitHub connection is healthy
5. You might need to disconnect and reconnect GitHub if there are issues
